# Handling integrated biological data using InterMine - Technical Setup

## Option 1 - install your own python üêç

For these instructions to work, you'll need a linux or mac machine. If you're running windows, we'd suggest you use [Option 2 - Jupyter notebooks](option-2---fallback---jupyter-notebooks--binder).

### Python

_Compatability note: InterMine currently automatically generates Python 2.7 compliant code (3 is in the works!). For this reason we recommend python 2.7, although the client does support python 3._

- Python 2.7 (we'd recommend Anaconda for [Python 2.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux))
- The [InterMine python library](https://github.com/intermine/intermine-ws-python) [![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/intermine/badges/installer/conda.svg)](https://conda.anaconda.org/bioconda)
- Optional: [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html) - this isn't necessary if you installed Anaconda at the first step.

## Option 2 - Fallback - Jupyter Notebooks + Binder

You can launch the python tutorials in a Jupyter notebook via [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs/master). Just click on the button below!
