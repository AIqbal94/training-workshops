## Downloading and running code from the InterMine results tables

We'll demo this live on the day, but if you'd like to try this at home or on a work computer, you can follow our [step-by-step guide to running an InterMine python script on your own computer](running-a-python-script-locally) (as opposed to running it in a Jupyter notebook, which we'll see next).

## Step-by-step analysis workflow

We'll step through a workflow similar to the one we did earlier, only this time the analysis is done in code, rather than on HumanMine directly.
