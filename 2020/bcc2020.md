- **01:00** ‚òïÔ∏è üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄ - Fifteen minute break. Grab a coffee and stretch your legs!
- **01:15** üêç Hands-on code along in Python (PAX6 Workflow):
  - Python Pax6 Workflow (unsolved): [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs/master?filepath=unsolved-exercises%2FWorkshop_Pax6Workflow.ipynb)
  - Python Pax6 Workflow (with answers): [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs/master?filepath=Workshop_Pax6Workflow.ipynb)
- **02:00** Self-learn exercises - use cases and questions. Your choice of:
  - üêç Python: [API Exercises](../2019/2019-06-19-python-exercises)
  - üêç: Replicate some of the exercises we've run today on your favourite organism or favourite genes / proteins. We can help walk you through it and troubleshoot where needed.

### Useful links
#### üêç Python

- [Python tutorial](https://github.com/intermine/intermine-ws-python-docs)
- [Python tutorials in short video format](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCom3brEDM9q3aZVh9Bg5IQeXw5wzR7Ep)
- [Python API docs](http://intermine.org/intermine-ws-python/intermine.html)

#### üá∑ R

- [InterMineR on Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/InterMineR.html) - includes links to the reference manual, vignettes, and install instructions.  
- [Jupyter notebooks, including the same Pax6 workflow, but in R](https://github.com/intermine/interminer-workshop/) (you'll need to have Jupyter running locally on your system with an R kernel, or copy/paste the exercises into to RStudio)

### Which InterMine is for me?
- [InterMine Registry](http://registry.intermine.org/) - search for your favourite organism(s). There are tens of InterMines and some InterMines cover a large number of organisms.

### Support:
- There are lots of links on [intermine.org](http://intermine.org) - in particular see the [developers section](http://intermine.org/developers/) for documentation and the [contact](http://intermine.org/contact/) section for support.
